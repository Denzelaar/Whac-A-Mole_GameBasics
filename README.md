# Whac-A-Mole
Whac-A-Mole project for the Game Basics assessment.

The Game
-  You can select the amount of moles you want to play with and the amount of time you want to play the game for.
-  The game ends when the timer runs out.
-  Moles will come up from their holes and hide again after a few seconds.
-  You gain points by clicking on the moles before they go down again.
-  When the game is over you are able to fill in your name to be able to register on the local leaderboard.

-  The Game is in portait mode, as I find this a better mode for faster mobile games.
-  With more time I would like to implement different animals coming out of the holes, like ones with traps or faster/smaller ones.
